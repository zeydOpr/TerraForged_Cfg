# TerraForged Mod Configurations
[TerraForged] is an immersive and customizable procedural terrain generator for Minecraft.

## Contents
### Maritime Boreal (Preset)
The preset, inspired by the moist regions of Alaska, Canada and Scandinavia, replicates the subarctic climate zone that forms the world's [largest land biome] with the [highest concentration of waterbodies] covered by wide, contiguous [conifer forests] on a [formerly glaciated terrain].

The influence of oceans that provides a [more moderate climate] with a narrower temperature range softens the cold temperatures. Snow cover occupies only certain areas on the landscape that experiences the coldest temperatures including alpine regions. The predominant vegetation formations are taiga canopy and scrubs. Temperate forest, grassland and tundra biomes can be encountered as [transition zones]. Human population and structure density is low.

The terrain consists mainly of hills and mountains that were shaped by ancient glaciers and rise from the surrounding plains. Various coastal landforms including cliffs, isthmuses, lagoons and peninsulas are more common due to the region's proximity to oceans and freshwaters. Floodplains may spread in the small continental areas, as waterbodies take up more space on the land.

The extensive [aquatic systems] that include [rivers, lakes] and [wetlands] occur where the [permafrost and glacial topography cause limited drainage and runoff] or create basins and valleys. Waterbodies can be found partially frozen in the colder areas where the snow cover is persistent.

### No Huge Mushrooms (Data Pack)
The data pack removes huge mushrooms of the dark forest in TerraForged to make the forest more realistic.

### Tropical Islands (Preset)
The preset replicates groups of ocean islands located in a hot and humid climate zone covered by tropical rainforests (also known as jungles) and grasslands (also known as savannas).

The region contains small and scattered lands that have enough space to settle on and are close to each other which makes exploring and travelling easy between them.
